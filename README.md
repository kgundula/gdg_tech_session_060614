=======================

This is the NodeJS+Sockjs Demonstrator which Ishmael Makitla presented at the Google Developer Group (Pretoria) Tech Talk Session.

To get started, git clone the repository and then run npm install.

Once all dependencies are installed, the big one being SockJS - you can start your Node application this way:

$ node ws_echo_chat_server.js  # this will start your node application and you should see happy log entries if all is well.

Test by opening your browser to http://localhost:8081 - this should should you the HTML page which you will use as your dummy SockJS client.

Please note that I have left some "TODOs" in the HTML - basically some JQuery stuff you may want to do to get a "working/usable" scenario going.

Happy Noding!!!
